# Building a Todo List

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to build this todo list:

## Demo

- [Open this](http://output.jsbin.com/kuxuta) in one window
- [Open this](http://output.jsbin.com/kuxuta) in another window.

Put the windows side by side like this:

Try:

- adding a task
- completing a task
- deleting a task

As you edit one todo list, the changes are mirrored on the other.

We don't expect you to be able to get up to Deleting Tasks, just adding things through Firebase.
