# General Overview

Hack Camp is broken up into _workshops_ and _projects_.

- Workshops introduce new concepts
- Projects help solidify the hackers' understanding of introduced concepts

Legend:

- **W** - Workshop
- **P** - Free-form project time
- **D** - Demos
- **MD** - Mini-demos. Shorter demos of work-in-progress. Things aren't expected
  to be finished yet.

Each column indicated the flow of the day. If a row containing **W** is followed
by **F** in the following row in the same column, that means that a workshop
will be followed by project-time that day.

## Week 1

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| W      | P       | W         | P        | W      |
| P      | D       | P         | D        | P      |
| MD     |         | MD        |          | MD     |

## Week 2

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| P      | W       | P         | W        | P      |
| D      | P       | D         | P        | D      |
|        | MD      |           | MD       |        |

# Days

Before each day, read through the guidelines for each activity. You can find the
guidelines by simply clicking the linked items in the `Activity` column of the
tables.

If the current activity being run is over an hour long, _make an announcement
saying when the next activity will start an hour before the current activity
ends_. For example, if people are currently working on their projects and the
next activity, demos, starts at 4PM, I should make an announcement at 3PM saying
when demos will be.

If the current day is a workshop day, make sure hacker pairs (that work together
in projects) are assigned in some way, shape, or form before brainstorming
starts. You should _assign_ these. Hackers should not be choosing their
partners. Please do make sure to explain _why_ we are assigning hackers
(explained in [Project-Formation](ACTIVITIES.md#project-formation)).

 https://github.com/hackedu/hack-camp/issues/426

For today's workshop the hackers have two choices:

- [Messenger](ACTIVITIES.md#messenger) (beginner)
- [Todo](ACTIVITIES.md#todo) (advanced)

We recommend beginners work through the messenger workshop and more advanced
coders work through the todo workshop.
