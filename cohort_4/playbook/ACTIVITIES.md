# Hacker arrival

Make sure hackers come straight down to the hackerspace when they arrive.

Have at least one leader in the hackerspace while hackers are arriving. When a
hacker arrives, the leader should vigorously and excitedly greet them as they come in.

>"good morning!"
>"how did you sleep?"
>"how are you?"

If they're on a team with another hacker, make sure both hackers sit together.

If a leader makes it to the hackerspace after other hackers have already
arrived, the leader should also vigorously and excitedly greet them.

## On the First Day

Hacker arrival on the first day is going to be a bit different than on the other
days. The hackers won't know where to go and they won't know the leaders of the
camp, so it's our job to make this as seamless and welcoming as possible.

We recommend doing the following:

1. Assign two leaders to manage hacker arrival and one leader to manage scanning
   of acceptance packets.
2. Have the assigned leaders text all of the hackers the morning of with
   something along the lines of the following:

  > Hey Alice! Can't wait to see you this morning. Just as a quick reminder,
  > the address is 44 Tehama Street in San Francisco. Can you shoot me a text
  > or give me a call when you get here?

3. Have the assigned leaders wait in the lobby for arriving hackers.
4. When a hacker arrives, have one of the assigned leaders guide them down to
   the hackerspace in the basement, mark their arrival in the
   [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Em5tUQdm4dXnthtWr4zY4KR9Q6JZMV_Hl2n6G9Ti9Bg/edit),
   collect and set aside their acceptance packet (they were emailed a packet
   full of waivers to sign before the cohort started), and then head back up to
   the lobby to wait for more arriving hackers.
5. Have the leader assigned for managing acceptance packets make sure they are
   scanned and uploaded to the shared Google Drive folder before the day is
   over.

It may be a good idea to play some music in the hackerspace while people are
arriving.

# Energizers

## Bad startup ideas

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 2-8 people, group into 2 teams
- when 8+, group into teams no larger than 4
```

- For the purposes of this example I will refer to `team A` and `team B`.
- Each team will break up and be given 2 minutes to come up with a crazy startup
idea.
- After the teams have ideas team A will take the role of investor and team B
will be a startup.
- Team A tells team b what startup idea they will be pitching.
- Members of team B come up with and announce their positions and roles at the
  company they are representing.
- For 3 minutes team B pitches the company.

> team A: You are pitching tinder for dogs
> someone on team B: I am the Chief Executive Director intern
> someone else on team B: I am a hot single dog and beta tester
> team B: We're here to tell you about the next big thing... tinder for dogs
> ~pitching continues for 3 minutes

## Card on Your Head

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: Enough space for the hackers to walk around
Number: 6 players and up
```

One hacker is given a card (realistically, a sticky note) with a noun written on
it (duck, cat, Kung Fury, Zach Latta, etc.); said hacker cannot read the card
and must stick it to their forehead. The other hackers must then do their best
to describe the noun, while the hacker with the card on their head guesses at
what's written on it. In case of big groups, divide the hackers into two groups.

## Duck, Duck, Goose

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: Lots of floor space for running
Number: 4 players and up
```

It may be a children's game, but who says that we can't do it too.

From the
[Wikipedia entry on Duck, duck, goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck,_duck,_goose):

> A group of players sit in a circle, facing inward, while another player, who
> is "it", walks around tapping or pointing to each player in turn, calling each
> a "duck" until finally calling one a "goose". The "goose" then rises and tries
> to tag "it", while "it" tries to return to and sit where the "goose" had been
> sitting. If "it" succeeds, the "goose" becomes "it" and the process begins
> again. If the "goose" tags "it", the "goose" may return to sit in the previous
> spot and "it" resumes the process.

## Evolution Rock Paper Scissors

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30
Source: Andrea
```

Everyone starts off in the “egg” stage and has to act like eggs like being in a
squatting position. Every “egg” will find another “egg” to play rock paper
scissors with. Play rock paper scissors until someone wins 2 out of 3. The
person that wins the rps round will then evolve into the next stage, which is
“chicken,” and has to find another “chicken” to play rock paper scissors with.
The “losing” person will remain an egg and find other eggs to play rock paper
scissors with. The stages are egg to chicken to monkey to human then to divine
being. In each stage, the “losing” person will de-evolve into the previous
stage or if an egg will remain an egg. So if you lose when you're a chicken,
then you become an egg again.  Once a person becomes a divine being he/she
leaves the game and watches.
Continue until you have a certain number of divine beings agreed upon at the
beginning of the game.

For example, assume there are 6 people, and they all default start at the
"egg" stage.  There will be 3 rounds of rock paper scissors total, so
egg1 - egg2, egg3 - egg4, egg5 - egg6.  There will then be 3 winners, so
chicken1 egg2 egg3 chicken4 egg5 chicken6, for example.  Then, there will
be 2 rounds going on, since there are an odd number of chickens and eggs:
chicken1 - chicken6, egg2 - egg3, while chicken4 and egg5 wait for partners.
Then when people lose, an example scenario is: egg1, monkey6, chicken2,
egg3, chicken4, and egg5.  This continues until there are a specific number
of divine beings you decide upon.

## Human Knot

```
Time: 15-30 minutes
Materials: none
Number: unknown
```

Start by making a tight circle with a group of 3+ people (the more the better),
and have each person grab two different people's hands, preferably people across
from you. This essentially "tangles" everybody into a knot-like structure, and
the objective of the game is to untangle this knot. You are permitted to talk
and collaborate, like "Step over so-and-so's hand" or "Go under this person's
hand." As a final result, everyone should be in a circle, with no crossed-over
body parts.

The amount of time this activity depends on how fast you can collaborate and
untangle the knot.

This energizer ends once the knot is untangled, but more rounds can be played if
desired. Keep time in mind - the time it takes to untangle can vary.

## Human Pictionary

```
Time: 10 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-8 people, group into teams of size 2
- when 9-12 people, group into teams of size 3
- when 13+ people, group into teams of size 4 or 5
```

- Organize the students get into teams.
- Announce that there is no talking in this activity
- Facilitator(s) will call out a random prompt (e.g. iPhone, giraffe, surfboard)
  and start the 30 second timer.
- Each team tries to represent that the prompt with their bodies in that time.
- At the end of the 30 seconds, everyone will freeze as the facilitator(s) goes
  around and judges the teams and makes funny and comments.
  - "This group is trying really hard not to fall. It really does look like the
    leaning tower of Pizza. Bonus points on being very angled."
- After observing all the groups, the facilitator announces the winner.
- The facilitator tells the winning team gets to pick, announce, and judge the
  next round.
- You can repeat this for the duration you want this activity.

## I Love My Neighbor Who

```
Time: 5 to 15 minutes
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-35
```

- Get everyone into a circle
- Facilitator starts "in the middle" by filling in “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____” with anything that applies to him/her such as “I love my
  neighbor who dances.” or “I love my neighbor who loves sushi”.
- People whom the statement also applies to have to move and find another spot
  in the circle.
- The last person trying to find a spot will then become the next person in the
  middle. He/she will fill in the statement “My name is _____. I love my
  neighbor who _____”.
- The pattern continues. If someone is in the middle more than once you can have
  someone who hasn’t been in the middle go in instead so we get to know
  everyone’s names.
- You can also encourage people to say things that apply to them that they don't
  think will apply to others. That way, it gets people to share things that they
  think "could only apply to them" and when they realize when it applies to
  someone else, bonding happens.

## Mumbled Messages

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: none
Number: unknown
Source: unknown
```

Mumbled Messages is a game where you try to pass around a message and compare
how it is at the beginning and at the end. People stand in a circle and the
message gets passed around in the clockwise direction.

Start by having one person, Person A, think of a complicated phrase to say to
the person on his or her left, Person B. Person A will then whisper that message
into Person B's ear, and Person B will whisper the message he heard into Person
C's ear, and so on, until the message gets around to the person on Person A's
right hand side, Person X. Person X will then say the phrase he thinks he heard,
and then Person A will say his phrase. Then the group will see how accurate
Person X's phrase was.

The energizer typically ends after one round (the message has been passed all
around), but more rounds can be run if necessary.

## Ninja

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: none
Number: <15
Source: http://www.wikihow.com/Play-Ninja
```

Start with having everyone stand in a loose circle with their eyes closed.
Select one person from the circle to be the "first to act" by tapping on their
shoulder.

Once you've selected the first player, have everyone open their eyes and stands
in the circle with their hands together to mimic a ninja's resting pose (like
[this](http://pad2.whstatic.com/images/thumb/d/db/Play-Ninja-Step-2.jpg/670px-Play-Ninja-Step-2.jpg)).
Have everyone jump at the same time and yell "ninja!", while striking a ninja
pose. The person previously chosen to be the "first to act" makes the first
move.

The first player decides if they want to attack the player to the left or to the
right of them. They don't tell the other players, because, as a player, part of
the fun is not knowing whether you're going to be attacked on the first round.

On attack, the player makes one fluid motion with the goal of hitting/slapping
the opponent's hand. They can only take one step with one leg or jump towards
another player with both feet. If they fall, they're out.

The opponent may dodge the attack. While the first player is making their attack
in one fluid motion, the other player has the opportunity to dodge the attack.
If the first player hits their opponent's hand, the opponent is eliminated.

Turns keep going in a circle until there are two players left, at which point
the game restarts with only those two players. They strike their ninja poses and
take turns attacking each other until there's only one ninja left standing: the
winner.

## One Word Radio

```
Time: 15 min
Materials: none
Team sizes:

- when 4-9 people, group into teams of 2 or 3
- when 9+, group into teams no larger than 4
```

- In this activity, teams of people will be taking turns acting as a radio
  station.
- The first team will stand on one side of the room while everyone else (the
  audience) comes up with a topic on the news.
- The audience will tell the news team what they have to broadcast.
- The news team must give a news broadcast one word at a time, switching between
  each person on the team each word.

> a: Today
> b: the
> c: White
> a: House
> b: put
> c: a
> a: ban
> b: on
> c: cookies

## Sharks and Minnows

```
Time: 5 - 10 minutes
Materials: Lots of floor space for running
Number: unknown
```

- Mark 2 end-zones roughly 8 meters across, 8+ meters away from eachother.
- In this activity one hacker will start as a shark and all the others will
  start as minnows.
  - The shark's goal is to tag the minnows
  - The minnow's goal is to get into the other safe-zone without being tagged by
    anyone.
- The minnows are safe in the end-zone they start on, but when a club leader
  shouts "swim!" they are only safe on the other end-zone and must run.
- If a minnow is tagged by a shark, the minnow is now kelp and cannot move.
- Kelp will try to reach out and tag the minnows as they run past. If a minnow
  is tagged by kelp, it also becomes kelp.

## Two Truths and a Lie

```
Time: 10 minutes
Materials: Lots of floor space for running
Number: 6 - 10 people
```

> Ask all players to arrange themselves in a circle. Instruct each player to
> think of three statements about themselves. Two must be true statements, and
> one must be false. For each person, he or she shares the three statements (in
> any order) to the group. The goal of the icebreaker game is to determine which
> statement is false. The group votes on which one they feel is a lie, and at
> the end of each round, the person reveals which one was the lie.

Source: http://www.icebreakers.ws/small-group/two-truths-and-a-lie.html

## Pterodactyl

```
Time: 4-6 minutes
Materials: none
```

All players must begin by knowing that the point of the game is to keep their
lips covering their teeth the whole time and never letting their teeth be seen
or they are out! They must cover them with their lips at all times. (pull them
over your teeth as you would if you were rubbing in lipstick.The game begins
with everyone in a circle and one player saying "pterodactyl" then the player to
the right of them says it and so on and so on.

The catch is that any player can change the direction by screaming / screech as
loud as they want or however they want just like a pterodactyl! This is when the
game gets really fun and almost every person is laughing!

## Where The West Wind Blows

## Zip Zap Zop

```
Time: 4 - 8 minutes
Materials: none
Number: unknown
```

Before the game, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyWKVGoXKak):

When explaining the game
- Spend 15 seconds verbally explaining the game (but actually 15 seconds)
- Then you want to SHOW the game. Grab 3 people and have to demo it like
  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP-MI_in6Fc).

# Introduction talk

Welcome to Hack Camp.

## Speaking from personal experience.

First of all, I wanted to preface that everything we say at Hack Camp comes from
our own personal experiences. None of the things that I say are necessarily
right, they are just how I feel. Each of us here, has different opinions and we
will each share our own views and opinions.

## Why is programming awesome?

- Make School Founder Jeremy Rossman had a really inspirational speech
- The smartphone in your pocket is more powerful than the computer we used to
  send a human to the moon.
- 30 years ago, our smartphones would have been considered more powerful than a
  super computer.
- 30 years before that it would have been considered magic.
- If you walked around in the early 20th century with an iPhone, people would
  think you could weild magic.
- And in a world where magic exists, there are people who know how to use magic,
  and then there are muggles.
- You want to be in category A.
- You want to know how to control the devices that can do millions of
  calculations per second, not for whom those those devices are a mystery
- Every year that goes by, there are more and more industries that can be
  transformed by computers. In fact, it's hard to think of an industry that
  won't be disrupted by technology
- There are industries that are radically changed by these devices every year
- If you were the king of the Roman Empire in 25, you would have ruled over 56.8
  million people
- By 2016, 2 billion consumers will have smartphones
- And you, if you can learn to weild magic, just sitting in your underwear in
  your bedroom, can create expreinces that impact 2 billion lives.

### Our objective running Hack Camp.

You might think that it is my objective for me to teach you this skill of
programming.

Sure, programming has been a very useful tool for me.

However, learning and viscerally feeling that I can create what I see missing in
the world, that I didn't have to follow all of the rules, that really changed
the way I looked at the world.

My goal here at Hack Camp is to share that feeling like that is a possibility.

I want to show you a
[brief clip with Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/kYfNvmF0Bqw?t=15s) that I think
sums this up well.

And the first step in being able to create what you see missing in the world is
viscerally believing that you are capable of doing it.

### Sports Analogy

Let's take a look at sports for a second.

*If I went went on a run, how might I know if I've gotten a good exercise?*

> Wait

Yeah, when I'm out of breath and my muscles start burning.

*Should I exercise as much as an olympic athele?*

> Wait

No, of course not, I can barely run `insert how much you actually run` right
now. I might actually die if I did that.

*Should the exercise an olympic athelte does be easy for them?*

No of course not. They should be equally as out of breath and having their
muscles burned if not more.

*So why are olympic atheletes more fit than me? Are they just born more fit?*

> Wait for response

No, they've just practiced and exercised many *many*, more hours than I have.

*Well for programming, how might you know that you've gotten a good exercise?*

> Wait

When you don't know how to do something, and you start getting confused, and
your brain starts hurting. That's when you have gotten a good exercise.

*What does it mean if you don't get confused, your brain doesn't hurt, and you
 know everything?*

It means that you're not learning anything new. You're just doing really boring
easy things and not stretching yourself.

### Growth Mindset

I want to share a piece of research with you that has really impacted the way I
thought about myself.

A Stanford University professor named Carol Dweck studies this phenomenon she
calls mindset.

On one side of the mindset scale is fixed mindset, which means that you believe
that your abilities in something are fixed.

On the other side of the mindset scale is growth mindset, which means that you
believe that your abilities in something can be improved.

If I were to say, I'm not really a math person, that means that you believe that
your abilities in math are fixed. That you were born with some finite set of
math abilities and they couldn't be improved.

If I were to say, "Yeah, I'm not really that artistic" it means that you think
that your art abilities are fixed. That you were born with a limited artistic
ability and you couldn't improve it.

If I were to say, "Yeah, I'm not that good with girls and I'm not that good with
boys either, you believe that your ability with men or women is fixed."

If you had a growth mindset about math, you might instead say "I'm not that good
at math right now because I havn't spent too much time practicing it because I'm
not too intrested in it"

If you had a growth mindset about art, you might say that I don't really have
too much experience in art right now so I'm pretty bad at it but I'm actually
pretty interested in it and would love to learn more.

So there are people here of all different skill levels of programming in this
room. Take `INSERT NAME OF PERSON HERE THAT IS BETTER AT CODING THAN YOU WHO IS
IDEALLY IN THE ROOM OR AT LEAST THAT SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS ABOUT`, they are much
better than me at programming. Now why is that? Is it because they are just
smarter than me?

> Wait for answer

No, it's because they've spent a lot more hours programming than I have.

So when you're learning something, should you be learning the same concepts and
building as quickly `ABOVE NAME`. Should you be picking up things at the same
rate?

No, of course not! They have spent a lot more time practicing as you. Once
you've spent as many hours (note hours, not years) as them, then you can expect
similar results.

There's an interesting experiment that they did with this:

She gave an exam to engineering students who she told was a measure of their
aptitude. They made sure that they did well on 2 of the tests but not on a
third.

Then they asked, which one do you want to take a tutorial in? After the
tutorial, we'll give you the test for that subject again and give you a
certificuit with a score emblazed on a certificuit.

Those with a growth mindset overwhelmingly chose to take the tutorial in the
subject that they did poorly on.

This seems to make sense because they can improve the skill they are the weakest
on.

However, those with a fixed mindset overwhelmingly chose to take the tutorial in
one of the subjects they did well on.

For those with fixed mindsets, errors and setbacks are calamaties, they are the
surest sign of unworthyness and they think, "I must hide my errors, I must not
let people know or else they will think I am stupid". This fear of errors in
those with a fix mindset closes people off to learning and growth.

When researcher from the University of Michigan, Jason Moser monitored brain
activity while someone with a growth mindset makes an error, the anterior
cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that monitors for errors, is extremely
active and processing.

And if you actually look at brain activity of someone with a fixed mindset, this
area of the brain is completely shut off.

At hack camp, we want to celebrate learning so we want to celebrate when we make
errors.

*So is the primary objective of Hack Camp to learn coding?*

No, not really. Think about this as an analog to a creative writing camp. You
wouldn't spend all day in a creative writing camp learning grammar.

You would be there thinking about what stories you could craft, how you could
move people's emotions, how you could sway someone's opinions.

I see programming as a tool for two things.

- a medium for self expression
- a tool to solve problems

and the most important part of doing those two things is knowing that you can do
it. This is what hack camp is about.

*Don't Ask For Permission, beg for forgiveness*

Don't ask us whether you can do something or not in hack-camp, just do it.

Ask us for forgiveness later.

There are no rules at hack camp, except one.

### Code of conduct

It is extremely important for us that Hack Camp is a safe space for each and
every hacker (yes, you are a hacker). That means that it is your job to make
sure that you do your best to make this a comfortable space for other people.

### Freedom

Therefore, everything at Hack Camp is optional. If you ever ask, do I really
"have to do this", the answer is no, you don't. That being said however, in Hack
Camp we will be following a set schedule, and if you'd like to deviate, please
do so. However, if you don't follow along with the workshops or don't build
projects in the schedule, you might be able to go in more of a direction you may
want to go in but there's also a chance that you'll fall behind - the choice is
up to you.

Plan to eat breakfast as a large group every morning on the third floor of the
building.

How to get it going:

1. Assign a leader to set up breakfast while hackers are still arriving.
2. To set up breakfast, the leader will need to:
  1. Bring the food we have for breakfast from the kitchen to the third floor
     dining tables. Our food is in the cabinets below the stove in the kitchen
     past the open working space on the third floor (not the kitchen right next
     to the stairs).
  2. Move tables together and bring chairs together.
  3. Bring out an adequate number of plates, bowls, and silverware (use
     discretion to decide what is adequate).
3. Once the leader has set up breakfast, and when it's time to do breakfast,
   have everyone take the stairs to the third floor.

The hackers may be pretty quiet during breakfast, especially on the first day.
We recommend taking this opportunity as a time to engage with them on a more
personal level and start building community within the cohort. The way we've
done this in the past is physically dispersing ourselves between the hackers
during breakfast and initiating conversations with the one or two people sitting
next to us through asking lots of open ended questions. We haven't had much
success when trying to engage the entire group in a single large conversation.

Plan to start cleaning up 5 minutes before breakfast ends. Make it clear to all
of the hackers that they are expected to clean up after themselves, whether that
means putting their dishes in the dishwasher or disposing of garbage.

## Lunch

On the first day, eat lunch as a large group. On all of the other days, give the
hackers freedom for the entire lunch period.

When eating lunch as a large group, eat on the _roof_. When doing this, _assign
one leader_ to go to the roof _15-20 minutes early_ and move tables and chairs
together to accommodate everyone. When the time comes to eat lunch, have the
whole group take the stairs to the roof. We've found that trying to take the
elevators with large groups can get pretty chaotic, especially when going to the
roof during lunch time (many Galvanize members all trying to get to the lobby
then).

# Morning Announcements

## Purpose

The purpose of morning announcements is to let the club know that feedback is
taken into account, and will be acted on throughout the day. This is essential
because it may not be extremely clear if club leaders are actively trying to
improve their club through the feedback of others. This also gives a sort of
"transparency" in the club leadership, as members know what exactly is going on,
in terms of improvements and/or suggestions.

## Delivery

Morning announcements will take anywhere from 3-5 minutes, and will cover
feedback that will be acted upon during the day. Not only that, the club leaders
will also mention the activities that will be happening throughout the day, such
as project time, demoing, and/or workshops. A way that club leaders may want
consider when addressing feedback implementation could be something like: "Hey
everyone, yesterday we got feedback about ______, and today we will be trying to
improve that by _____." This will reassure club members that they are having a
say in what direction the club takes.

# Pairing Guidelines

Since there are many ways you can pair people in your club/camp, there are
several guidelines that should be followed. Organization of this should be
maintained in a spreadsheet, and partners should be purposely paired for maximum
efficiency and ability to work together.

## Spreadsheet Creation

You should create a Google Spreadsheet to maintain organization for pairings.
Spreadsheets allow one to cleanly see each pair, and provide a means of access
for each person in your leader group. The ability to share and collaborate with
your team members is ultimately beneficial as it should reduce the number of
mistakes and incompatible pairs.

## Compatibility and Uniqueness

Pairings will not work out if the partners are not compatible. Skill is
something to keep in mind, of course, but it is not necessarily the one thing
that pairings depend on. If a person was sociable and communicated well, but did
not have much experience coding, a pairing with a more advanced person would
still be possible because the more advanced person gets teaching experience,
while the less advanced person can still learn. This may not be true for quiet
individuals - the pairing is less likely to work, and may result in a less than
ideal result. It is also seen pairing two people of similar levels is
beneficial, although one should be able to communicate well.

Uniqueness is also important - no two people should be paired together again
unless everyone has already been paired with each other. This will help members
of the club all form bonds with each other.

## Types of Pairing

### Pair programming between beginner-advanced pairs

Pair programming between beginner and advanced hackers is fairly similar to
normal pair programming. They should still be rotating regularly. Do note: we've
observed that advanced hackers often have the tendency to want to drive the
coding completely.You may need to have to help them resist that urge by showing
each hacker what they are getting out of it:

For the advanced hacker:

- True mastery of a subject can only come once someone is at the point they can
  explain it to someone. If a hacker can't navigate while pairing, they dont
  have an in-depth understanding of the topic.
- This is practice in working with people who don't know as much
  subject-specific information. Teaching this content to a beginning hacker is
  practice for any future interaction with teammembers.
- A team is only as strong as its weakest link. Helping teammembers gain more
  experience and increase their knowledge can pay off later.

For the beginning hacker:

- Focusing only on the code is a good way to get familiar with syntax and build
  up muscle memory.
- Anytime the driver is lost, they can reach out to the navigator.

# Workshops

## General Guidelines

### Breaks

If hackers don't take a break, they will likely get very antsy. We recommend
doing one of the following:

- Reminding them to take breaks every hour / hour and a half.
- Saying that you personally find that you become much more productive when you
  take regular breaks. At Hack Camp, feel free to take a break whenever, we
  don't want to baby you so we won't remind you.
- Something else that works best for you.

### Checking In To Every Hacker

We want to make sure each hacker's energy level is high. One way to ensure
that is to make sure that they're working on something that they're excited
about.

If a hacker is disengaged, that is the opposite of excited.

One way to get a very disengaged hacker is that if

- they are presented with material that is much easier than their skill level
- or much harder.

The much easier is much harder to detect for because if you ask them,

> "Do you need help"

They will say they don't. (Note that even though you ask someone who is very
confused, they may say they don't need help as well because they are perhaps
too afraid to ask for help or have already disengaged).

Instead, the strategy for checking

Here are some role playing scenes:

```xml
<facilitator> Are you good?
<hacker> Yup.
<facilitator> *walks to the next person*
```

The above interaction doesn't give you any perspective on how they are doing.
The default answer is that they are good so most likely even if they aren't
they will say the are good.

```xml
<facilitator> How are you doing? *seems like a more open ended question.
<hacker> Yup.
<facilitator> *walks to the next person*
```

Even though this wasn't a yes or no question, that data you get back is still
pretty minimal. You have no idea what's actually going on. You want people to
kinda ramble.

```xml
<facilitator> Hey how's it going?
<hacker> Good.
<facilitator> What are you working on now?
<hacker> I'm working on the javascript
<facilitator> *keeps pressing on to ask more questions*
Oh, cool, which part are you working on?
<hacker> I'm trying to get the button to work
*amazing, we finally got some information that
<facilitator> cool, what do you want to get it to do?
<hacker> well, when I click it, this error comes up and I can't seem to find it
```

In the above interaction, you get a lot more data to diagnose with. Its like a
doctor who sees a patient and the patient says fine and so the doctor walks
away. Instead the doctor asks many different kinds of questions to trigger
different possible reactions their patients.

One amazing question is:

- "Tell me more about that"

This questions really lets you to get the other person to ramble and give
you a lot of information.

Other kinds of probing questions include:

- "What's the thing that's taken you the longest?"
- "What are somethings that have been the most confusing so far to you?"

### Driving People to their Maximal Potential

Each has different things that excite them and that they find challenging.

People are not just ate different levels that each other, they are on different
axis completely.

Make sure you try to push people to their maximum potential, doing things that
are hard enough for them / in something that they in particular are interested
in.

```xml
<facilitator>
  *notices that the hacker is kinda exhausted and is playing agar*
  *decides to walk over*
  Hey, how is it going.
<facilitator>
<hacker>
  Oh hey, I'm just playing Agar
</hacker>
<facilitator>
  Cool, how's the project going
</facilitator>
<hacker>
  Well...
</hacker>
<facilitator>
  How excited are you about the project?
</facilitator>
<hacker>
  Yeah, its good...
</hacker>
<facilitator>
  *notes that the hacker doesn't really care about what they are doing*
  Hmmm, so I notice you're really into games. Want to try to to build Agar.
</facilitator>
<hacker>
  Maybe?
  *continues to play agar*
</hacker>
<facilitator>
  *I might go and go away and check in with them later*
  *after like 10 minutes*
  Yo, so check some of these games out that people have made:
  *shows demos*
</facilitator>
<hacker>
  Whoah, this is awesome! Can I try?
</hacker>

```

## Portfolio

[Click me for link.](workshops/portfolio)

### Prerequisites

- All leaders must complete the workshop

### Running it

- make sure you follow the [general guidelines](#general-guidelines)
- talk about the ratio / schedule of workshops to projects (to illustrate the
  point that we are only doing these workshops to give you experience to work on
  your own projects)
- today you're going to learn how to build a very basic website and learn about
  the fundamentals of building a website
- the website we are learning to emulate
  [looks like this](https://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/20618752b7afa95bbbc5c5ba80c17874ec5e0a35/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/portfolio/src/final_portfolio/index.html)
- you will be making a simpler version of that
- some of you already have a lot of experience with HTML & CSS
  - feel free to skim through or skip the guide and try to emulate the website
    or work on making a more complex or different website
  - also fee free to use your own IDEs
- Give a brief overview of HTML, CSS and JS
  - There are 3 components to a webpage
    - HTML, CSS, and Javascript
  - HTML is for the Data
  - CSS is for the look and feel
  - Javascript is for interactivity
  - Open up Facebook
    - This website has all 3
    - Open the chrome console, delete the head tag (which deletes the styles)
      - This is what a page looks like without CSS
    - These are the two we're focusing on Today
- Paste link to workshop.
  - Here is the link to the workshop
  - Talk about how it's important to ask for help
    - From facilitators
    - From your peers
    - Encourage collaboration

## Maestro

### Running It

Make sure you follow the [general guidelines](#general-guidelines)

Make sure you show all of the 4 demos at the very beginning to show what you can
make.

Tell the hackers to feel free to be able skip through the content that they are
already familiar with. This is designed for beginners in mind.

Also, do the demos inside of this project using Google Voice. You want to be
able to recieve text messages and phone calls on your Google Voice number
so that people can see it on the screen as you demo it.

[Maestro Workshop](workshops/maestro)

## Instagram

### Running Instagram

#### Before the workshop
- Be sure to understand the coffee shop example and know when to expect students to ask you questions during the example
- Make sure you are familiar with how the advanced code in the back works as well.

#### Here are the bullet points of what you might include to preface this workshop

*Before the demo, pull up at least 2 pictures in new tabs that you can copy and paste the URLs of into the demo app.*

- We have done HTML and CSS by itself, we have done javascript by itself, teaches you how to combine them together by building a very simple version of Instagram.
- Checkout the [demo](http://jsbin.com/cacaqa)
    - when I click on the button
    - a popup asks me for a URL for an image to put into Instagram
    - Here, I have a picture of a cat. I'll copy and paste it's url into the input
    - and then press ok
    - viola, the image is not added to the screen.
    - lets add another picture
    - I'll copy and paste the URL of a different picture, and then press OK.
    - and bam, there's another photo
    - Note that in this simple version of instagram, the pictures are not saved if you closed the window
    - refresh the page
    - now see, they are gone.
- So you'll be learning how to combine HTML & Javascript in this one
- Also, you'll be learning the fundamental aspects of computer science along the way
- If you are very familiar with DOM manipulation and this is really easy for you, there's a section with a much more advanced version of what this instagram app could be. Take a look at that code, play around with it, and see if you can make it your own! Definitely don't force yourself to go through what you already know well! Warning: this code is not that simple.
- Demoing the advanced application
  - [live demo link](http://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/instagram/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/instagram/src/index.html)
  - This should be inspiring to advanced and beginner hackers alike.
    - Advanced hackers may feel they can build this and get excited.
    - Beginning hackers will begin to see what's possible.
  - Step through the application as you demo
    1. The first step is to have a listing of phone numbers prepared ahead of
       time so you can quickly copy and paste from them later.
    2. Open the
       [live demo link](http://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/instagram/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/instagram/src/index.html)
       up in two windows (not tabs, windows so that they can be seen side by
       side).
    3. Copy and paste all the phone numbers of all the students (have a listing
       of phone numbers prepared ahead of time so you can quickly copy and
       paste)
    4. Copy two of of the students numbers into your mobile phone.
    5. Now that you're setup, you're ready to make an announcement.
    6. Tell all the students to turn their phones to loud.
    7. Tell all the students to open
       [live demo link](http://rawgit.com/hackedu/hack-camp/instagram/cohort_4/playbook/workshops/instagram/src/index.html)
       on their computer.
    8. Go and upload a picture
    9. Tell the hackers the following:
      - The app uses local storage to remember the phone numbers even after it
        refreshes.
      - The app uses the Dweet API to send pictures to all of their screens.
    10. Then show that you can upload a picture from mobile as well by taking a
        picture of the class.
      - This will send the picture to two of the students whose names you've
        type in earlier.
      - This will also appear on the screen.

### Todo Readme

[Todo Readme](workshops/todo/README.md)

# Demos

Demos are the hackers' chance to show off what they have been putting so much
time and effort into for the past day or two.

If they started their projects earlier in the day, then the demo is considered a
_mini-demo_ and hackers are encouraged to show their current work in progress.
If it's the second day they've been working on their project, then the hackers
are encouraged to show a minimum-viable-product (MVP) of their project. Ideally
this would be somewhat functional and demonstrate base functionality.

- Presentation order depends on who volunteers.
- Each team should start off with something they failed at
  - Make sure to give context by explaining the basic overview of the app and
    why this is a failure
- After presenting something they failed at, they can show off what they made
  - We recommend encouraging teams to have everyone speak during the demo to
    reinforce that projects are _team_ efforts and to give everyone on the team
    explicit ownership

## Whiteboard information

During demos it can be hard for hackers to remember what they must include in
their presentation. To help hackers keep this in mind it is good to have a
whiteboard within view that includes the steps to giving a demo.

Step-by-step instructions for presenting:

1. Start showing your project being used.
2. Talk about how your project works.
3. Something you have failed at (and optionally how you will resolve it).
4. Something you have learned by doing this project.

It can also be hard to remember how to give feedback. Make sure the hackers can
see these tips (on a whiteboard) when writing their feedback:

- Don't be afraid to point out failures or flaws; this feedback is annonymous.
- Try to have something presenters can improve on, and something they did well.
- Feedback helps hackers get better at presenting. The more the better.
- Ask yourself if you had just presented the same thing, what feedback would you
  like to be given.

## Links

Before kicking off demos, we'll want to collect links to all of the web projects
from the hackers in the Slack. To do just, just send out a message along the
lines of the following:

    3:40 PM <zrl> @channel: Hey all! The time has come to collect links to your
                  projects. If you have a project that works on the web, please
                  just paste a link to it here. Don't hesitate to ask us for
                  help doing that!

Ideally all links would be collected by 10 minutes before demos start, giving a
good buffer if any hackers run into errors getting their projects online.

If their project is not a web project, we recommend using a Google Hangout on
the computer connected to the projector and the computer they developed on and
using screen sharing to share their work. It's certainly less than ideal, but it
has worked in the past.

## First-time demos

When explaining how to demo to hackers, first point out many things that can be
done incorrectly when demoing. Club organizers can do this by presenting fake
demos with something wrong that the hackers must point out.

Common practices to avoid when demoing:

1. Talk with no reference to your visual open (just the code).
2. Talk with your demo open but you don't reference anything onscreen.
3. Referencing things without pointing to them with your mouse.
4. Referencing things without using it or modifying it.
5. Talk about how useful a piece of code is without pointing to it.
6. Referencing your code without any code open.
7. Referencing a specific line of code without pointing to it.
8. Use the mouse pointer to point to what you say you changed but don't change
   anything.

It may be helpful to give an idea of what a demo may look like by showing one.
In the past we've shown https://youtu.be/MY01d647S9Y to the hackers and gotten
good results.

## Giving feedback

Feedback helps hackers improve their presentation and demo skills. To keep demos
running smoothly, feedback is going to be written on sticky notes instead of
shouted out after the demo.

- Pass out sticky notes and pencils/pens to the hackers.
- Have the hackers write the number of the team on the sticky note above their
  feedback (the first team to present is team #1, the second #2, and so on).
- Collect the feedback after demos are over and sort it into groups. Then give
  the feedback to the group it is for.

# Freeform Projects

This assumes the hackers are already in groups and have decided what to work on.

If they have not yet, refer to [project formation](#project-formation).

## Scheduling

- make sure to collect links 10 minutes before demos at around 3:50. make sure
- you remind people of what time the demos is. It is very easy to forget to
  mention the time.

## Role Of The Organizer

Walking the rope of how to be effective during this time period can be hard. On
one hand, you want to actively help hackers. At the same time, you don't want to
hover and so you stay back and let the hackers do their thing and work
independently.

You want them to ask questions abut at the same time you don't want them to ask
you a question when they never searched for it themself yet.

Being a good organizer is knowing when to step in, and when to hang back. If
unsure, bias on the side of hanging back.

Checkout the guidelines for [Answering Questions](#answering-questions).

Every set of freeform time for projects culminates in a demo by the end of the
day. See the [demo section](#demos) for more details, including what hackers are
encouraged to have finished.

*What NOT to do*

- DO NOT drive the conversation
- DO NOT just cause you notice the hackers doing something in a way that you
  wouldn't do don't just start telling them they're wrong. Maybe you're wrong or
  maybe you're both wrong.

*What To Do*

- DO checkout the guidelines for [Answering Questions](#answering-questions).
- DO let the hackers drive the conversation
- DO make sure that each person is challenging themselves to their personal
  limits.
- DO ask for feedback from the hackers constantly to see what things are
  breaking especially when people aren't realizing.
- DO remind the hackers of the link collection time as well as demo time

## Scoping and concept

- Sometimes hackers will become too focused on a particular part of their
  project.
  - Make sure to remind them of their project's scope.
  - It is in their better interest to not focus on minor details because they
    have to finish before demos. They can continue working on details later. A
    working project is always better than a nice looking broken project.
- Explain minimum viable product to the hackers.
  - Compare MVP to building a rocket-powered flying scooter. Before building the
    rockets or polishing the wings, you must build the scooter.

## Engagement

- The activity is only beneficial to hackers that are engaged.
  - Make sure both partners are equally engaged. If they aren't, try to diagnose
    the problem.

## Facilitating

Rotate between hackers often. Don't hover over one hacker unless they have a
specific question that you are helping them with. We recommend biasing towards
giving them more freedom and autonomy than less.

Sometimes hackers will need to be prompted to ask questions. We recommend
prompting them by asking things like the following when checking in.

> How is it going?
> What can I do to be helpful?

## Answering Questions

Before helping resolve questions, we recommending doing your best to
have a clear understanding of the problem (ex. the hacker expects clicking the
button on the form to create an alert, but when they click it, no alert is
created). We've found that sometimes hackers, especially beginners, will ask a
question seemingly unrelated to the actual problem they're trying to solve
(perhaps not knowing the correct terminology plays into this).

While resolving a question, we recommend letting the hackers lead the
actual problem solving so they can build up their experience solving problems
independently. We encourage you to ask open ended questions to help drive the
conversation in the right direction, but the hacker should have the wheel.

We also recommend avoiding answering questions directly. Instead, we recommend
helping hackers find the answer on Google to also build experience solving
problems independently. If you think they'd have trouble finding the something
on Google (ex. if they don't know about the existence of the JavaScript
console and it's the tool they need), then feel free to explain it to them
directly. Use your discretion for when to do this.

Moreover, we recommend encouraging hackers to reach out to their peers for help.
After Hack Camp, the facilitators will not be as accessible, but the hackers
will still have access to peers with coding experience.

Biasing for searching the web also works well if the hacker you're working with
has more experience than you. We've found that going in with the mindset of
"let's solve this together" instead of "I'm going to help you solve this" has
been helpful.

A couple more recommendations:

- Let the hackers fail. If they find something independently that you know won't
  work (ex. some bad JavaScript from w3schools or StackOverflow), let them try
  it out and discover that it doesn't work on their own.
- Along the lines of what's above, it's okay to have sub-optimal code when
  learning. Let them discover technical debt on their own.

### Example

Let's take a quick look at what we'd recommend doing when helping a hacker:

    <hacker> The button isn't working.
    <leader> What do you want the button to do?
    <hacker> I want it to show an alert when clicked.
    <leader> And what does it currently do when clicked?
    <hacker> Nothing.

Boom, we just identified the problem. They want a button on the page to show an
alert when clicked, but, when they click it, nothing appears to happen.

    <leader> Alright. Are there are errors in our code?
    <hacker> Maybe?
    <leader> How might we find out?

At this point, the hacker may know they can check the JavaScript console to see
errors on the page. If they don't know about the console, now might be a good
opportunity to explain it (or bring up how they used it in a previous workshop,
if they have). In this case, we're going to assume the hacker has used the
JavaScript console and knows they can use it to see errors on the page.

    <hacker> We could check the console.
    <leader> Cool, let's do that.
    ...
    <leader> Does the console say we have any errors in our code?
    <hacker> Yeah, it looks like there's one.
    <leader> What is it?
    <hacker> "button is undefined"

Alright, so we probably won't have much luck if we have them search for "button
is undefined" directly. At this point, we may want to guide them with open ended
questions to search for something a bit more specific.

This specific example ends here, but hopefully it gives a preliminary idea of
what we recommend answering questions should look like.

# Project Formation

In the workshop / projects model, three quarters of a hacker's time is spent on
their projects. Project formation sets the foundation of a good project.

Here are the steps to project formation:

(_we recommend doing each of the below for things each time_)

1. Forming groups [2 minutes]
2. Yes-and sessions [5 minutes]
3. Brainstorming [23 minutes]
  1. Part 1: Generating Ideas [13 minutes]
  2. Part 2: Filtering Ideas [10 minutes]

## Forming groups

### Pre-Work

Follow the guidelines for pairing in [Pairing-Guidelines](#pairing-guidelines).

Make sure that the spreadsheet with the information for pairing

- is in a location that everyone knows about
- is easily accessible
- is open before getting the campers attention

### During Hack Camp

```
Time: 2 mins
Materials: The spreadsheet with the pairings you've made in it
```

- Get people psyched that they get to work on building their own projects
- Remind them of some of the following without sounding repetitive
  - projects are awesome
    - because you get to create what you see missing in the world
    - you get to really hone your skills when you build a project
  - working on people who are at different skill levels improves your skills
    - if you are less experienced than your partner
      - you can pick their brain and watch how they do things
      - be corrected on how you do things
    - if you are more experienced than your partner
      - you get to test and synthesize your knowledge of the subject by being
        having to explain it to someone else.

## Yes-and sessions

```
Time: 5 mins
Materials: The spreadsheet with the pairings you've made in it
```

_Note this activity can certianly get a little old if done repeatedly so feel
free to insert your own favorite improv activity that has a similar effect
here._

- One of the biggest inhibitors to a successful brainstorming session (instructions
  on how to run brainstorming below) is that people turn down the ideas of
  others as well as their own ideas before they can even see the light of day.
- "Yes-and" sessions are exercises from the improv world that help people get
  into a a mindset of non-judgment and therefore creativity before
  brainstorming which will help help them not turn down ideas.
- Note that the Yes-and session is NOT the actual brainstorming activity itself.
- In a "Yes-and" session, pairs of hackers build off each-others' ideas to
    create long, completely nonsensical ideas. And since a partner must go along

### Running a Yes-and session
- Start with a live example between facilitators (yes, actually do a live
  example each time)
  - ex: https://youtu.be/Qe2a3ppacUk
  - ex: between person A and person B:

    > A: Let's create tinder for unicorns
    > B: And it will be super effective, and the unicorn population will
    > increase 1,000 times.
    > A: Yes, and there won't be enough food for the unicorns
    > B: So they'll build a spaceship to search for new planets to colonize!

- tell the hackers to stand up
- tell hackers to be in their pairs
- briefly remind the hackers why we are doing a yes and session
  - to help your creativity flow by stopping judgment
- verbally remind them to
  - go along with whatever their partner says
  - to say the first thing that pops into their heads not have judgment
- Have the hackers jump into a "Yes-and session" for 4 minutes
- wander around the groups and listen in on the sessions as people are doing
  their yes-ands
  - if there is any group that has failed to start or is very quiet
    - help get them started by saying something like
      - "Just say the first thing that comes to your head!"
    - however, don't actually help them by choosing a topic, they need to do
      that
- Start passing out sticky notes and thicker tip pens for the brainstorming
  activity now.
    - each individual person should have
      - 1 sticky note pad (try to have partners have different colored pads)
      - 1 ideally think pen (not pencil)
- give them a 45 second warning before coming to a close
- then at the end ask something like "Does anyone want to share any crazy
  stories that happened?"

## Running a brainstorm session

### Part 1: Generating as many ideas as humanly possible

```
Time: 13 mins
Materials:

- Individual sticky pad for each person
- try to have different colored sticky pads per person
- a pen to write with (ideally having a thinker point)
```


People should be energized now from their Yes-and sessions

- Make sure hackers remain standing
- Make sure each *individual* hacker has
  - their own pad of sticky notes (try to have partners have different colored
    pads so that you can tell if a person in a group is not producing stickies)
  - their own pen (ideally thick pen)
- Explain how brainstorming works (you want to remind people by explaining how
  to do this each and every time). Make sure you say **each and every** one
  of the below points:
  - make sure that you have
    - your own pad of sticky notes
    - a pen
    - you should have one pad of sticky notes in one hand and a pen in the other
    - (as you say this demonstrate holding a one in one hand and a pad of
      sticky notes in the other)
  - * say the below a very enthusiastic and passionate voice *
  - * particularly **emphasize** the words in **bold** *
  - you want to go for ***quantity***, not quality
  - write ***any*** idea  you have down
  - do not judge any of your ideas
  - you want to write down anything that comes to your mind
  - just like in "Yes-and", you can build off your partner but you don't have to
  - as you write the idea down, say the idea out loud so your partner can hear
    you
  - *demonstrate the above by actually writing at least 3 sticky notes down*
    - here are some ideas
      - "tinder for cats"
      - "remind me to call mom"
      - "free food finder"
    - make sure you
      - write the idea
      - say the idea out loud
      - vigorously slam it down on the table for emphasis
  - You can then emphatically say "GO!"
- Now your job is to monitor the pairs brainstorming
  - you want to focus your attention on individuals / groups who are producing
    a low amount of sticky notes and urge them along
  - you might go up to the group / individual and say some of the following
    - I notice that you don't have too many sticky notes, what are you thinking?
    - Just put down the first thing that comes to your head, there are no bad
      ideas
    - if you're very comfortable with the person, you might in a joking tone,
      say "dude, you guys got to up their game, look at how many sticky notes
      that other team has.
    - go, go, go, go, moar sticky notes!
  - if you notice that people in a pair are imbalanced at producing sticky notes
    (you will notice this if pairs have different colored pads)
    - help the one with less sticky notes in the same way as above.
- generally try to refrain from adding your own ideas to a brainstorm but
  sometimes even with a lot of encouragement and enthusiasm, a group doesn't
  come up with enough sticky notes and you can help them suggest ideas
- If done right, each pair should produce around 25 - 50 post it notes in one
  brainstorming session.

### Part II: Filtering the ideas

- This is when you can start sorting and judging the ideas
  - You can group post-it notes into similar concepts or ideas
  - or just pick out your favorite
- Hackers should chose two or three ideas they are interested in working on.
- Organizers can help them narrow their final decision down to one idea.
  - It is important that organizers review project ideas before hackers start
    working.
    - Explain the concept of MVP and help the hackers scope their project
    - Building a large project can take a long time.
    - Organizers must make sure the scope of the project is something the hackers
      can handle in the time they are given.
    - If you notice that the scope is too large, you might say some things like
      - "Well this idea might take a grad student 2 years to build, this other
        one however"
      - You can also try to get them to see the scope themselves: "Hm, what
        steps do you think you could take on this? Oh, how long do you think
        that would take?" and hopefully guide them to the answer.
      - Ideally though, you'd let the hackers fix scope themselves because that
      is a skill in and of itself. You want to try to be as hands off as
      possible if you think it would be a net positive.
      - Use your discretion whether you think a team would benefit from scope
      pruning now, or later. Depending on the idea, there may be no way to
      re-scope the project later and the team will need to pick a new project.
      Also a team may be very strong and can iterate and pivot ideas very
      quickly in which case this wouldn't be a problem. However, there may be a
      team that would significantly lose morale if this was brought up later.
- By the end of the brainstorming session, the ideas should be widdled down to
  just one idea.

# "I have failed" activity

This activity will:

- Enable people to acknowledge their failures because they know that the
  response they will be met with support, not judgment
- It gives everyone else an appropriate response when someone fails so they know
  what to do.

Demos will involve failing in front of the whole club. This activity is a good
preface to get the hackers into a positive mindset about public failure. It is
important to be supportive when someone fails publicly.

1. Have everyone form a circle (including club leaders).
2. Explain to the hackers the goal of this activity.
3. Explain that everyone will be sharing something they failed at
   - These should be things that they have not resolved yet
   - When they share it, they must shout it out in an overly dramatic way
4. Start by having the club leaders saying something they failed at, then go
   through the circle
   - Applaud and cheer when someone shares their failure

Here are good example failures that haven't been resolved:

  > I showed up late today!
  >
  > I didn't have enough time to make my site the way I wanted to!
  >
  > I didn't ask for help when I needed it!

# Feedback Forms

At the end of each day we want to collect feedback from the hackers to see what
did/didn't do well and understand how the hackers feel about camp as it
progresses. The feedback may also be helpful to diagnose issues with certain
parts of camp (ex. the second workshop was particularly difficult and many
people got lost and felt frustrated the day after).

When giving the feedback forms to the hackers, it is _very important_ that the
hackers feel that giving feedback is important. We don't want them to feel like
they're filling out the forms to appease us. Rather, we want them filling out
the forms because they want camp to be as good as possible and they know that
giving valuable feedback improves camp for everyone.

Making hackers feel like giving feedback is important can be broken down into
two parts:

1. Telling them why we want their feedback
2. Actually acting on their feedback and _showing_ that it makes a difference

When it comes time to send out feedback forms to everyone, we recommend saying
something along the lines of:

> Hey everyone! We're going to send out a link to a feedback form for today. We
> want to do _everything we can_ to make camp as good as possible and we can't
> do this without you.
>
> Please be as harsh and critical as you feel comfortable, we are going to do
> everything in our power to make this a great experience for each and every one
> of you.

Before going into the [post-mortem](#post-mortem) at the end of the day, we
highly recommend reviewing the feedback from the hackers and bringing up any
points of feedback that stand out to you in the post-mortem so it can be acted
on.

A quick note about the feedback forms: one of the fields, the anonymous
passphrase, lets us track an individual's feedback day-to-day without knowing
their name. _Make sure that hackers use the same anonymous passphrase each day_.
An explanation of what this field is in day 1's feedback form (linked below).

All of the feedback form responses will be put into the appropriate sheet in
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D8y_UB11C4QrXB9kn86-UqVQQqT9FUDqftx1AMHIb3o.

# Finishing off the day

Congratulations! We made it!

We generally do two final things to finish off the day.

1. Make any final announcements for the following day
2. Gather everyone in a nice and cozy circle near the front of the hackerspace,
   put our hands in, and, on three, all yell "Hack!"

![](img/hack_cheer.gif)

# Post-mortem

The post-mortem is a meeting between everyone involved in running Hack Camp and
is our opportunity to review the day and plan for the next.

During the post-mortem we'll visit each row in the schedule for the day (see
[`SCHEDULE.md`](SCHEDULE.md) for the daily schedules) and have everyone in the
meeting share any tasks they want to do as a result of that row in the schedule.
If it's decided to do the task, then it'll be recorded in task list and assigned
at the end of the meeting.

For example, if the following is the schedule for the day:

| Time     | Activity     |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 9:20 AM  | Energizer    |
| 9:45 AM  | Breakfast    |
| 10:15 AM | Project time |

The agenda for the post-mortem will be:

1. Energizer
2. Breakfast
3. Project time

We'll be doing our best to keep the post-mortems as brief as possible, so
_please come prepared with what you want to bring up for each item in the
post-mortem's agenda_.

# Using Slack

We've gone ahead and created a Slack for Hack Camp over at
https://hack-camp.slack.com to use as a place for communicating with hackers
during the camp.

All of the leaders of Hack Camp should have administrative access to the Slack.
If you're a leader and you find that you aren't an administrator, shoot
[@zachlatta](https://github.com/zachlatta) a message and he'll make sure that
changes.

## Asking for help

If a hacker says `slackbot help` in anywhere besides a PM in the Slack, all of
the technical mentors for Hack Camp will be pinged. For example:

```
> 3:35 PM <mahahahajan> slackbot help
> 3:35 PM <slackbot> gemma jonleung maxw rolandocruz saescapa selynna zrl
```

If you'd like to be added/removed from the list, let
[@zachlatta](https://github.com/zachlatta) know and he'll get right on it (say
`slackbot help` somewhere in the chat to see who's currently on the list).

# Communicating with the Group

In this modern day and age, we're fortunate to have _not one_, _**not two**_,
**but THREE** methods of communication in camp.

1. Announcing to the whole group
2. Sharing an announcement to each hacker individually
3. Using `@channel` on Slack

_But when do we use these marvelous methods of communication, you ask?_

## Announcing to the Whole Group

Say you're about to begin lunch and you need everyone's attention pronto. This
is the perfect opportunity to use that first method of communication: making an
announcement to the whole group.

The first rule of speaking to groups: **SPEAK LOUDLY**.

If you're not used to speaking loudly, speak so loud you feel uncomfortable with
the volume of your voice (it may even hurt a little). Speaking loudly is the
first step to effective communication to groups. If people can't here you, it
doesn't matter what you're saying -- half the group will never hear it.

Got the _loud_, **BOOMING** voice thing down? Perfect. Next step: make sure you
have everyone's attention while speaking. Someone not paying attention? Wait for
them to start listening to you before continuing.

Announcements to the whole group, while they may be quick and easy, are a
dangerous tool. Be wary of interrupting hackers if they're working independently
and especially use it with caution during project time.

## Sharing Announcements Individually

Oh no! You were about to start the workshop, but it seems like nearly half of
the hackers are having trouble connecting to the internet. Have no fear! The
second communication method---sharing announcements individually---is here!

When sharing an announce to each hacker individually, go hacker to hacker and
let them know what's going on. In this case, we'd say that some hackers are
having trouble connecting to the WiFi and ask if they were experiencing any
issues themselves. If so, we'd work with them individually to get those issues
resolved before moving on to the next hacker. If multiple leaders are available,
it may be worth having multiple leaders go around the room doing this.

This type of communication is best when an announcement may affect some, but not
all, of the hackers and you don't want to interrupt everyone to share it.

## Slack Announcements

Ah! Last, but most certainly not least, we have making Slack announcements.
Slack, like many other pieces of software, is really quite a neat creation.
Hackers can message others and send emoji with relative ease, all while
continuing to hack away on their creations.

Slack has a very nifty feature that lets us send a notification to everyone in
the channel by including `@channel` in our message.

A couple examples:

    3:53 PM <selynna> @channel: post links here! @alexfine that's fine
    11:02 AM <saescapa> @channel: Here is today’s workshop! https://git.io/vOKNK
    12:03 PM <selynna> @channel: hey all! did you bring lunch?

Slack announcements are great for pretty much everything that isn't covered by
the first two communication methods. They're non-intrusive, so you're not
interrupting anyone, and they're very easy for the hackers to respond to.

Want to give everyone a heads up about lunch happening in 30 minutes? _Slack._

Want to send a link to everyone? _Slack._

Was there an event at Galvanize that had some extra food and offered it to our
hackers? _Slack._
