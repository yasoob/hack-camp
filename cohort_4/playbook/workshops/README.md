# Workshops

This directory contains all of the workshops for Hack Camp. The order for
running them is as follows:

1. [Portfolio](portfolio)
2. [Maestro](maestro)
3. [Instagram](instagram)
4. [Messenger](messenger)
5. [Todo](todo)

If a hacker wants to deviate from this order, we recommend encouraging them to
do so. However, we do suggest using the above order as the default, as outlined
in the [schedule](../SCHEDULE.md).
