# Breaking Down The First Iteration

We decided to build this very simple version of Instagram:

Here is a [demo](http://jsbin.com/cacaqa).

## Breaking Down The Components

Instead of trying to build this entire project at once, we can break down the
problem into smaller problems, making it much easier.

The components of this app are:

- when I click a button
- ask the user to give it a URL to an image
- add the photo to the page

At this point, if I don't know how to build this, I could try googling
`when I click a button add an photo to the screen`. However, it will be hard to
find someone else who has written about this exact problem. It will be much
easier to find out how to do each of these components individually.

Therefore, I could 

1. figure out how to do something when a button is clicked. Anything! I don't
   care what it is.
2. figure out how to ask a user for a URL for a given image
3. figure out how to add an image based on the URL that the user gave

Only after doing this would I go and do the HTML + CSS because the JavaScript 
is harder so I want to do that first.
