Can you create a bullet point outline of the portfolio project above?

First, delete the entire line:

  <h1>Zaphod Beeblebrox</h1>

Create your outline directly inside of the body tag in the 
`index.html` file like this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Zaphod's Portfolio</title>
      </head>
      <body>
      
        <!-- YOUR OUTLINE HERE -->
        - executive
          - president
          - vice president
        - legislative
          - congress
          - senate
        - judicial
          - supreme court

      </body>
    </html>

IMPORTANT: To save time and to limit frustration, spend 3 minutes trying figure out how to do this. If you havn't found what you wanted after 3 minutes just advance to the next page and we'll walk you through it!
