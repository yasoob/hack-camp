# Challenge: Adding the description

Let's figure out how to add the description so that it looks like this:

**Desired vs Current**

## Looking at the Outline

Let's take a look to see where we are and where we want to make our changes.

You should currently have the below code.

I added a `<!-- ^ NEXT -->` to point out what lines of code will be changed
next.

```html
<!-- PORTFOLIO -->

  <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
    - https://i.imgur.com/vS0HhER.jpg 
  
  <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
    <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1>
    - I want show people that the world is malleable. I want them to know they can create what's missing and not be afraid to break the status quo.
    <!-- ^ NEXT -->

  <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION -->
    - link to Facebook (https://facebook.com/jonleung137)
    - link to Twitter (https://twitter.com/jonathanjleung)
    - link to Github (https://github.com/jonleung)
```

## Asking for Help

At this point, you know you're supposed to google, but you have no idea what!

So you ask the facillitator:

> I want to put the description on it's own line underneath of the `h1` tag. How
> do I do that?

The facillitator may respond:

> Use a paragraph tag! Google will tell you how to use it.

You can go back to the previous challenge page to look at how to formulate a
good Google query.
