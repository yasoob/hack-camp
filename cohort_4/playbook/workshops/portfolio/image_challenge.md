# Image Challenge

Let's figure out how to add the image at the top of the page:

**What we want:**

![](img/desired_image.png)

**What we have:**

![](img/url_not_image.png)

Right now we just have a URL for the image displaying as text but want the
actual image to be shown on the page.

## Looking at the Outline

Let's take a look to see where we are and where we want to make our changes.

You should currently have the below code.

I added a `<!--<<<<< NEXT -->` to point out what lines of code will be changed
next.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Zaphod's Portfolio</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- PORTFOLIO -->
  
    <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
      - https://i.imgur.com/vS0HhER.jpg  <!--<<<<< NEXT -->
  
    <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
      <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1>
      <p>I want show people that the world is malleable. I want them to know 
      they can create what's missing and not be afraid to break the status quo.</p>

Now it's your turn to use Google to figure out how to add an image to the page! 

Feel free to add an image of yourself or anything else. If you're not sure
what photo you want, just grab your Facebook profile picture url
(see the pro-tip below).

For this challenge, I don't think I need to give you a hint for what
to google for, I think you can figure it out!


IMPORTANT: To save time and to limit frustration, spend 3 minutes trying figure
out how to do this. If you havn't found what you wanted after 3 minutes just
advance to the next page and we'll walk you through it!
```
