Let's figure out how to add logos to the currently text only social media links.

## Looking at the Outline

I added a `<!-- ^ NEXT -->` to point out what lines of code will be changed next.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Zaphod's Portfolio</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- PORTFOLIO -->
  
    <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vS0HhER.jpg" alt="Photo of Jonathan">
  
    <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
      <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1>
      <p>I want show people that the world is malleable. I want them to know 
      they can create what's missing and not be afraid to break the status quo.</p>

    <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION -->
      <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanjleung">Twitter</a>
      <a href="https://facebook.com/jonleung137">Facebook</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/jonleung">Github</a>
      `<!-- ^ NEXT -->`

  </body>
</html>
```

Now it's your turn to use Google to figure out how to make the links actual 
images instead of text.

Here are the links to the respective logos:

  Twitter

  Github:

  *Note, I got these images from iconmonstr.com
  a great service for finding free icons!*

IMPORTANT: To save time and to limit frustration, spend 3 minutes trying figure out how to do this. If you havn't found what you wanted after 3 minutes just advance to the next page and we'll walk you through it!

For any image that you want to add to your website, you can always upload them `imgur.com` and link to the images on imgur.com
```


## Potential Google Scoping
Here are a listing of Google queries sorted from the top down from worst to best.

- `html how do you add logos to your website`
    - Problem: Well, this isn't what exactly what you're looking for. You're just trying to add an image instead of text in a link
- `html how do you make an image a link instead of text`
    - Problem: `instead of text` will only narrow your search to websites that mention `instead of text` but you don't actually care if `instead of text` appears on the website or not. All you want is:
- `html how do you make an image a link`
    - Problem: the words `how do you` and `an` `a` are extraneous for google.
- `html make image link`
  - Problem: the specific article we are looking for may not include the word 
- `html image link`
  - Awesome.
