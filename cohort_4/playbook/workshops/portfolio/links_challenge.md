# Challenge: Adding links to social media

Let's figure out how to add the links to the 3 social media websites:

__What we want:__

> ![](img/social_media.png)

__What we have:__

> ![](img/social_media_highlight.png)

## Breaking down the problem

It is easier to solve smaller problems. Instead of immediately making the social media links be nice pretty pictures, we can do this:

![](img/text_social_media_links.png)

After we figure out how to do the above, we can always make it facier later by adding images.

## Looking at the Outline

Let's take a look to see where we are and where we want to make our changes.

You should currently have the below code.

I added a `<!-- ^ NEXT -->` to point out what lines of code will be changed next.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Zaphod's Portfolio</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- PORTFOLIO -->
  
    <!-- IMAGE SECTION -->
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vS0HhER.jpg" alt="Photo of Jonathan">
  
    <!-- INFORMATION SECTION -->
      <h1>Jonathan Leung</h1>
      <p>I want show people that the world is malleable. I want them to know 
      they can create what's missing and not be afraid to break the status quo.</p>

    <!-- SOCIAL MEDIA SECTION -->
      - link to Facebook (https://facebook.com/jonleung137)
      - link to Twitter (https://twitter.com/jonathanjleung)
      - link to Github (https://github.com/jonleung)
      `<!-- ^ NEXT -->`

  </body>
</html>
```

Now it's your turn to use Google to figure out how to add the text links (not image links) to the social media sites! 

For this challenge, I don't think I need to give you a hint for what
to google for, I think you can figure it out!


IMPORTANT: To save time and to limit frustration, spend 3 minutes trying figure out how to do this. If you havn't found what you wanted after 3 minutes just advance to the next page and we'll walk you through it!
