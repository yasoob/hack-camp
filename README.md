Hack Camp is hackEDU's summer program. It's a two-week program for high school
students who want to make things with code. We'll bring participants from their
first line of code to publishing their first project.

## Website

Check out the `gh-pages` branch for Hack Camp's website.

## Objective

The objective of Hack Camp is build an set of materials that allows any hackEDU
team member to reproduce an experience that that brings people from no coding
knowledge to having the ability, motivation, and confidence to create coding
projects and continue learning new coding concepts with others, without the
explicit urging or leading of a teacher.

This can be broken down into two parts: creating the experience and reproducing
it.

#### Cohorts

##### Cohort 1

_June 1st - June 12th_

Unfortunately we didn't clarify our objectives for Hack Camp until the first
cohort was over, so we didn't have anything set for this.

##### Cohort 2

_June 22nd - July 3rd_

The objective of the second cohort is to only do the first part of the Hack Camp
objective: creating the experience. Our goal is to create an experience that
brings people from no coding knowledge to having the ability, motivation, and
confidence to create coding projects and continue learning new coding concepts
with others, without the explicit urging or leading of a teacher.

We should be taking personal notes on what we're doing and how we're doing it at
this stage, but we shouldn't be creating documentation for others to reproduce
our work yet.

##### Cohort 3

_July 13th - July 24th_

The objective of the third cohort is to improve our work from the second cohort.
We want to do the best job possible satisfying the first part of Hack Camp's
objective.

We should be taking personal notes on what we're doing and how we're doing it at
this stage, but we shouldn't be creating documentation for others to reproduce
our work yet.

##### Cohort 4

_August 3rd - August 14th_

The objective of the fourth cohort is to have another member of the hackEDU team
reproduce the experience from the second and third cohorts from a set of
materials.
