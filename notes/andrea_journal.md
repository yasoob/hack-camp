# Andrea's Journal

COHORT 2

Monday 6/22/15

Intro
-logging into wifi, irc
-maybe not frame it as were not here to do programming but that there's more to programming
-Creating who you are/failure is good but i think it needs a stronger/more clear intro before this - you just jumped into it
-not sure about saying stuff like we didn't secure the venue and the payment system - fine line between showing failure and appearing nonprofessional (use other examples of failure besides setting up hack camp as a failure)
-failing doesnt mean you didn't put effort into it

Manifesto
-be explicit and open about purpose of the drawing activity afterwards - differences is small speck of manifesto, we want to get a sense of everyone, aware that we are different and to respect each with those differences. you might not agree with certain opinions but do respect theirs
-have pairs make specific and actionable values**

Yes Lets
-have laptops down
-some ppl not paying attention

Hacking Internet
-Max - good job clarifying that this is structured and rules but after this is a lot of open ended stuff
-a bit slow? 2 ppl playing 2048

HTML/CSS Basics
-I like showing removing CSS and javascript
-Exploration
-Presentations: they sat in their seats, Mathew needs to project more
-good asking them what the value, attribute etc are on the second presentation!
-what else is a tag asking is good
-Presenting: max good explanation of showing what not and what to do

-maybe have a form asking how much time they spend on coding at home after camp
-selena doing other work because she's learned a bit html/css - good balance of levels

-hack camp ppl help each other
-feedback realtime - raise your hand

--------
Do first part. 

Wednesday 6/24/15

Do now was pretty good

Pencil Exploration
-was a bit long before giving more direction
-what we're supposed to do/obective unclear

After lunch
-Max asking if they would like to do this and this - they might not know enough to know?
-when about to start building agar/atari, taking too much time to start
-there was a point wen the way to talked to sam was eh about like it doesnt take a coding person to search, kind of demeanoring


THursday 6/25/15

-took really long in the beginning to explain - first have an outline of what to say it was too "oh and this... and this... and this", repeating yourself a lot, uncoordinated - not exactly on the same page
- jonathan you repeated what you said about phaser - too long of talking
- dont say "like actually" jonathan and that its for kindergardeners youre kind of putting that idea into their head.
- the way you present options isn't really options you say scratch is good, phaser and pencil is ehh and dont recommend
-objective: fundamentals of javascript - what is that?
-stop saying ppl think its for kindergardeners


COHORT 3

Monday 7/13/15

hacking internet
-they are collaborating. Sam said, "if you need help just come ask me. awww"
-most ppl working together cept tyler, alexis, victor, i just realized theres only 3 girls out of 10 :/
-ppl at different paces - some getting board
-not sure how it's working with different levels of hackers
-room gets kinda cold
-running into troubleshooting problems - things not being updated, internet issues (i feel like this would happen during clubs a lot)


Tues 7/14/15

-pairing seems to work well. People seem engaged and working together. Rolando helped another pair behind him!
-helping Leila/Alyssa: Jonathan says how to make this problem smaller problem
-Leila seems hesitant about asking peer for help (from her expression when jonathan was talking to her)
-victor and ylan seem to be working together really well
-Leila seems sad a lot. She said she's really good at the quiet game and just likes a lot of really sad movie and things etc. She seems to connect with the other hackers less.
-Rolando seems to be really helping victor/ylan. ylan was on her phone for a bit
-I feel like while we want to be hands-off there is a bit too much hovering (they arent as actively doing work than watching/listening to you while you're there)
-Ylan on her phone and Victor coding. Seems like they are stuck so Ylan is getting bored so going on her phone.
-yayay Ylan and Victor did something that worked and go really excited!
-Rolando spent more time helping other ppl than doing his own project - let's find a balance with that
-Jonathan - when letting rolando drive you; loose
-good job with Leila Jonathan - 

Tyler Situation
-not as social, doesn't like working with others bc in school theres a lot of school projects and he tends to do 90% of the work and other ppl piggy off of him
-he also doesnt like not knowing things and showing that (hence why he may be unfomfortable with learning to code with others because he's new to it)
-have a GUY talk to him about the things he wants to do and what would be helpful and to explain that coding is about failing and learning. growth mindset?

Wed 7/15/15

-ppl seem interested in growth mindset talk, tyler was a bit on his laptop towards the end

Thurs 7/13/15 VISITING CAMP SUDO (BERKELEY)

-Camp Sudo
-http://www.campsudo.org/
-https://www.facebook.com/campsudo?pnref=story
-June 29 - July 31, M-F 10 AM to 4 PM

Objectives of Visit
-What resources do they use to teach HTML, CSS, Javascript?
-How much exploration vs. lecture based learning do they do compared to hack camp?
-How often do they ask the instructors, peers, and google etc to find the answer?
-What sorts of bonding activities do they do? What are the  students’ responses to them>
-How do they organize the day?
-How often and long are the coding parts of the day? non-coding parts ?
-What seemed to work well?
-What seemed to not work?
-What is the relationship between the students and instructors like?
-Ask students about how the experience is. What are “shortcomings”? Would you keep coding afterwards?
-What sort of projects do they do? 2 and demo once or a few time (optional)

Day of the camp are they on: Week 3 Day 4 

Lecture on Javascript
-In the morning, students seemed tired. There are students with their heads down. Someone in the side back with headphones on. There’s a lot of students to instructor ratio. 15 students, 1 main instructor, 1 other instructor but he was sitting on the side most of the time (other than going around while they were working on projects later), 1 assistant who's just on the side with eyephones in and not really paying attention, he heats up food for lunch. Feels like an elementary school classroom (I feel even though coding is a new subject for them, they are high school students and need more freedom). Wonjun tells a lot of information (feels more like feeding info). Things that seemed good were asking questions but not everyone participates (the same few do).
-moments of silence and side chatter when instructor writes lengthy stuff on board.
More people in back seemed distracted/bored, people in front seemed more involve tho some were on laptops
-**Do students sit in the same spot everyday? - yes, they tried switching seats but cliques started forming
-instructor ignored side comment: “it would be an error though without the semi-colon” and just continued (maybe better gage of classroom?)
-explained variable syntax clearly
-instructor took a while but didnt directly address another question/comment
-some people are are quieter dont speak out as much - same ppl answer questions
-maybe for variables draw out pointers
-**Do they fill out feedback forms? What are some feedback students have given? - they do do daily feedback forms
-too much time for instructor writing on board and students not having anything to do
-one student in front on youtube
-calling out student to answer question as she hasn’t talked much yet, but ppl are kinda loud and chatting, laughing, you then ask someone else so she didnt get to really try (maybe work it out with her)
-students do “adventure game” in codeacademy
-some ppl was on youtube but almost everyone ended up on codeacademy
-plays spotify
-cliques have formed
=didnt hear much life or big talk convos
-a lot different student demographic, different student demographic from us.
-after lunch 1 hr building tallest tower game (each 4 person team had $5 to buy supplies from dollar store), no one traded supplies, many ppl were kinda bored by it? one team didnt clean up after themselves
-1 hour left after lunch and game to do codeacademy adventure game (if not finish it’s hw due tomorrow)
-**Are there punishments if they aren’t doing the work you tell them to e.g. playing games when you told them to do Codeacademy
people don’t know how/what to google (what they dont finish is hw and checked the next day)
-the room is really warm, ppl on youtube and slendar man
-one person googled to figure out how to keep background image fixed
-ANDREA WILL MEET WITH WONJUN, KEVIN, NATHAN
