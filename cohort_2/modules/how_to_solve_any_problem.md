5. After about 8 minutes of going nowhere, ask for help
	1. Ask in the format "I want to do X, I tried doing Y"

### A) What is the Objective / Problem?

### B) Brainstorm Solutions
1. Go for quantity, no judgement
2. Then go for quality, judgment can then be turned back on.

### C) Define Minimal Viable Product
Arrive at a very clear understanding of the game, how it works, what language they want to use, etc. They should create very clear, concrete expectations for themselves and what they are to achieve: e.g. create one level of Space Invaders with a set number of aliens NOT a five level progression with progressively larger numbers of faster aliens within each level.

### D) Plan Iterations
Break down the problem into tiny small manageable chunks and sort the order for which you will approach them in. Each chunk should be as tiny as possible. If you can make a chunk tinier, do it. If your problem is very small in scope, you may only have 1 iteration so this step is not necessary. For almost any project, it will be almost guaranteed that there will be at least several iterations.

For most students this is the most difficult part of the pipeline. Students must identify the components of the game but not as programming constructs.

Fill this into the iteration planning sheet.
Iteration Planning (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yO69909AZ3vw3sXGHAcRGJqI9ZZ6Yc9VF_YvV74p30E/edithttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1nC6VrkIpl7G4IcGgRxvcvC591HvJJdlrzlUySgH0fOs/edit)

### *For Each Iteration:*

--

#### 1. Understand the Game / Abstraction

Students must identify the components of the game in terms of programming constructs. For example students might identify that they need a “list” to store the amount of aliens they have, “if” statements to determine whether one has been shot, “event handlers” to control space ship movements, and a variable for score.
Figure out what you're thinking: Remember when you tried to tell Paul how to stand up, you had to try to sit and stand up a lot? Or when your brain "magically" found the maximum value in a list, you broke it down to figure out how your brain actually found the largest value in the list

Break the problem into small tiny chunks that you can attack separately. #divideandconquer

***If you get stuck, do the Google***

#### 2. Write Your Test Cases (Expectations) on Paper (ie like an example)
If this functionality were already working, how would you use it? How would you expect it to work?
What set of inputs would be important to test?
What do I expect my output to be equal to?

#### 3. Pseudocode on Paper
Algorithm: Once students have determined what programming constructs must be used via abstraction, they can begin writing pseudo code. It helps to begin with English before moving into proper pseudo code. There might be several iterations before a proper pseudo code is obtained. For example the following is a perfectly acceptable place to start:

when the game starts there are 20 aliens. until there are no aliens repeat the following steps:
wait until the keyboard is pressed: if it's the space bar shoot, if it's an arrow move.
If something is being shot, check if it hits all of the aliens in the list of aliens. if it hits an alien, remove that alien from the list.

Write it out on

Then Hand Trace the Pseudocode on Paper
You should be making marks all over the pseudocode trying to replicate as viscerally as possible the experience of writing the program.

#### 4. Code:

Have students translate their pseudo code into a real live program! Typically students are best at this step, as they have very clear rules to follow and need only worry about bugs and syntax.
