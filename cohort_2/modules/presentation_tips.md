# Presentation Tips

## How to demo (a presentation)

To show students what not to do in a presentation, show them a bad
presentation. Run through a presentation with each of the following errors and
ask them what you did wrong in each of the following examples.

After doing each of these have the hackers suggests what you could have done
better, then demonstrate their suggestions. Repitition is key here, so do each
example even if it seems similar to another example.

Presenting anything:

1. Talk with no reference to your visual open (just the code).
1. Talk with your demo open but you don't reference anything onscreen.
1. Referencing things without pointing to them with your mouse.
1. Referencing things without using it or modifying it.

For example, when explaining how login works, instead of having just the
dashboard open and then saying "when the user clicked on login before, the code
in the backend that validates that the user exists, note the importance of this
line, and then it goes into the dashboard"

Presenting code:

1. Talk about how useful a piece of code is without pointing to it.
1. Referencing your code without any code open.
1. Referencing a specific piece of code with the code open but without that
   code being on screen.
1. Referencing a specific line of code without pointing to it.
1. Use the mouse pointer to point to what you say you changed but don't change
   anything.
