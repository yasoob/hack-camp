## Objectives:

**Primary Objective**

Malleability.

To be able to navigate the world feeling that everything is malleable: the social constructs around you, your knowledge, the way you learn, who you consider as "self", etc.

**Objective for Hack Camp**:

To leave you at the point where:

- have the ability, motivation, and confidence to continue
    - learning completely foreign things on your own
    - creating completely new things on your own
    - without any prompting of a facillitator

**Objective for end of Week**
Project days are Thursday + Friday. These days will be a combination of learning and building! You will need to learn to do things on your own that you have never done before to be able to complete your projects.

**Objective for the Day**

- Get you to the point where you start learning on your own
    - You can effectively use resources to learn on your own
    - You can find resources to learn on your own
    - This will also have the side benefit of maximizing one on one time.

## Resources Summary:

**CodeHS**

- Pros
    - Moving from Scratch to Javascript
    - Extremely good at introducing fundamentals of CS and problem solving (10/10)
- Cons
    - Not necessarily the most motivating examples (you move a dog around a screen)
    - You do not necessarily learn how to build "real things"
- See below on how to use CodeHS effectively
- Signup
    - [Here](https://codehs.com/signup/individual/grading)
    - They will not prompt you to build your own project so unless you go in to this with trying to build a project in mind, you will not build a project. You have to remember to stop being spoon fed by them and try swimming yourself by building your own project.

**TreeHouse**

- Pros
    - Show you how to build real things like a real developer
- Cons
    - Very weak on the the fundamentals and theory.
- See below on how to use CodeHS effectively
- Signup for a Free Trial
    - [Here](https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/new?plan=3&trial=yes)
    - Use this credit card information below to signup so you won't be charged.
    - They will not prompt you to build your own project so unless you go in to this with trying to build a project in mind, you will not build a project. You have to remember to stop being spoon fed by them and try swimming yourself by building your own project.

### Other Resources

Note that I have not had time to vet these. There are some things that we did vet that we were like, OMG THESE ARE TERRIBLE!

**[CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com) / [KhanAcademy](https://www.khanacademy.org)**

I personally hate CodeCademy and don't like KhanAcademy but some people like it (you have to read things very, very carefully in CodeCademy). Primarily good a learning syntax but not for fundamental thinking, fundamentals of building, and you never really build real things...)

**[The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)**
- Know that this is a resource that points to other resources and is NOT hand-holdy at all, they will point you to a resource and exepect you to figure it out.
- [You may want to start on Step 3 of this page](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101)

**[Bento.io](http://bento.io)**

A listing of MANY of the resources across the internet
- [You may want to start here](https://www.bento.io/tracks) and checkout tracks 2 and 3.
- You would not want to do these linearlly, jump aroud to what you would want to do

**Others**

- CodeCombat (a video game to learn coding, it's a bit slow ion progression)
- [A cool reference](http://www.codermania.com/en/javascript/lesson/1a/hello-world)
- [Another cool reference](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/)

## Maestro Challenges (Objective)

For all of these, you will need to refer to [Maestro's Documentation](https://gist.github.com/jonleung/7a11c8553ca9b98f7a3c)

##### Using a Pre-Existing Function Challenge:
Use Maestro to send a text message to any phone number.

##### Using a Pre-Existing Function Challenge:
Use Maestro to send a MMS (multimedia message) to any phone number. (Lets' you send a photo to a phone number!)

##### Using the `prompt` function to send a custom text message
Have the user give a phone number and an image url to the program and send that image to the phone number as an MMS.

- Use the `prompt` function to ask the user for a phone number
- Use the `prompt` function again to ask the user for a URL to an image they want to send

##### Using `if` statement
Do the same thing as the above challenge ("Using the `prompt` function to send a custom text message"). but before even asking them for a phone number or an a url to an image, ask them to enter a password first. If they enter the password wrong, don't ask them any further questions, just stop. If they enter the password corrently, let them send a MMS as in the above example.

## Using Resources

- Above, you are given some Maestro challenges, when you feel that you are able to tackle them, go give them a try!
- Otherwise, you may want to jump between CodeHS and TreeHouse. When you're bored of one, go to the other. When you feel you are ready to takle a challenge / want to make up your own challenges with Maestro or otherwise, do that!

##### CodeHS
- I think watching / doing these linearlly is fine. Obviously if you feel like you really understand a concept, feel free to skip the exercises. I personally find all the exercises are pretty high quality (I did all of them : )
- I personally like watching the videos at 2x so I use the YouTube player.

##### TreeHouse

I'd recommend the [Front End Web Development track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development). I may not go in their entire order though.

Here is a potential suggested way that you might be able to go through this:

**You can potentially skip**
- How to make a website
- CSS Basics

You will probably learn new things if you did this, but you have enough of the fundamentals down to skip it for now.

**Start Here**
- JavaScript Basics
    - Introducing JavaScript
    - Storing and Tracking Information with Variables

After doing this module's two sub modules, check if you can try tackling the Maestro Challenges above!

**Then**

Potentially skip these for now:

- HTML Forms
- JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects
- Object-Oriented Javascript

And perhaps try this:

- jQuery Basics

Skip this one

- HTML Tables

And try perhaps try this one

- Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript

Along the way, feel free to explore the other resources listed in other resources as well.

**Suggested Ac**

**Going from Scratch to Javascript**

- CodeHS is a great way to move from Scratch to Javascript.
    - The programs that you worked on in Scratch are much more programatically complex than any of the things you will work on today.

## Maestro
    ***IMPORTANT:** Make sure to disable "auto run js"*

> ![](https://i.imgur.com/YAzF4Jp.png)

**See a working example**
[See this template on how to run your Maestro code](http://jsbin.com/budumawuwo/edit?html,js,output)

**Read The Documentation**

See the documentation [here](http://meowth.servers.hackedu.us:8000/docs.md)

 Focus on the commands

 - sendSms
 - sendMms
 - call
 - callAndPlay
 - callAndSay

**Write Clone**
"Fork" the above JS Bin and work in there
