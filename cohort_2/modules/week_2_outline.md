- Extract Concepts from [Image](https://i.imgur.com/g8ANW6w.jpg)

## Objective
To show people that they can create what they see mising
and not be afraid to break the rules.

=> Everything's Malleable

## Start A Project Whenever You Want To

## Example Module

- (Standard) Use google to solve a problem
	- (Objective) Use Boolean Operations
		- (Metrics) Given a sheet, they can convert it

## Motivation Skills
- Students set goals for what they want to learn in a given day
- Students ask facillitators to help them shape their learning plans, not to walk them through it

## Students build websites using HTML & CSS
**When you need to build websites with multiple files**

- Students build websites in an IDE (unlike JSBin or JS Fiddle and like c9.io or Brakets)
	- students link to other HTML files with `<a href="filename.html">`
	- ...link CSS...
	- ...link Javascript...
- Students preview their website by serving it from a server
	- students name their main HTML file `index.html` and create it in the root

**When you want to be able to add something new to the page after it is loaded, for example for Twitter, clicking a button and adding something new to the page**
	- Students can explain DOM terminologoy
		- node, parent, child, sibling

## Students use a Git & Github Pages workflow to deploy their code
**When you want to put your code on a permanent domain**
- Students use git & Github to track their work
- Students use Github Pages to host any web content they have
- Students can deploy multiple websites using Github Pages

## Fundamentals of CS
**When you want to be able to actually be able to write code**
- Statement vs Expression
- Code is executed line by line
- Students identify which programming concepts to use when they run into a problem
	- Remembering => Variables, Repeating => Loops, Choosing => Conditionals
- Varibles
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Objects
- Functions

- TODO: extract concepts from Scratch Projects
- NOTE: A plethora of examples documenting each thing would probably be helpful

## Fundamentals of Javascript
**When you want to be able to actually be able to write code in Javascript**
- Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Objects
- Functions

## Problem Solving
**When you problem is so big you're not quite sure what you're supposed to do next**

### Students use google to solve problems they are facing
**When you know want it to do but don't know how to do it**
- Students translate what they are looking for into a Googlable Query
- Students know how to break down a problem so that it is Googlable
- Students make a specific problem more general so they may increase their changes of finding an answer
- Students effectively phrase queries
	- Do not use extraneous words
- Students use Google in a timely fashion from when they had a problem
- Students use an effective workflow
- Students use titles and descriptions of Google Search results to determine if the page is relevant to their question
- Students effectively determine whether a given resource is relevant to them or not.

### Students ask for help at the appropriate times
**When you tried everything else and it still doesn't work**
- Students effectively ask their peers for help when they can't find an answer from Google
- Ask facillitators for help when they cannot find answer from their peers

### When a problem becomes to challenging, students break down their problem into solvable pieces
**When you don't even know what you should even be doing**
- TODO: make sure you say this is one way you may do that.

### Debugging
**When your code isn't working and you're not sure what to do next**
- Students know how to debug HTML + CSS
- Students know how to debug a Scratch program
	- Duplicate blocks to evaluate value
- Javascript
	- Debugger

## Presentation Skills
**When you want to communicate more clearly what you're doing**
- Students effectively demo
- Students effectively present code

## Notes On Each Platform
- CodeHS
    - Fundmentals of CS (Thinking & Building)
    - Great for introductory curriculum, we can create analogous challenges that call and text a phone number in parallel with their curriculum.
        - Perhaps these are taken from CodeCademy
        - Perhaps they are made and we provide solutions...
   - If statement exercise makes no sense
- CodeCademy
    - Syntax
- CodeCombat, potentially good

Demo All The Kinds Of Things That You Can Do

- CodeHS
    - Fundamentals of CS
- CodeCademy
    - Syntax
- CodeHS
- TreeHouse
    - Javascript Basics
        - Introducing Javascript
        - Storing & Tracking Information
        - Working with Making Decisions
   - Interactive Web Pages with Javascript
   -
    - How to actually work as a developer
    - Syntax
    - How to continue learning : )
- CodeCombat
    - I want a game around what I'm learning
- Much quicker overview after you've done CodeHS
    - http://www.codermania.com/en/javascript/lesson/1a/hello-world
- A reference http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/
- https://www.bento.io/javascript
- https://www.bento.io/tracks
**- It's really about taking these and inserting projects and emphasizing how to learn**
    - Ask the user for a phone number to send a message they want to send to.
    - Get a random image and send it to someone
    - Send a random song to a random person
    - Create a Meastro random project generator?

- One thing we may consider doing is creating a bunch of do now exercises
