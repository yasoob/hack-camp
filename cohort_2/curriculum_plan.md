Daily
- Explicitly show computational thinking (Idea --> Abstraction --> Algorithm --> Code) in examples
- Demos everyday

-  NO ARRAYS?!
-  Fix blockley run in script tag properly

Provide CSS

Have cheatsheets of all fundamental concepts made and ready to teach before camp starts so that we can have impromptu mini lectures that seem more structured.
