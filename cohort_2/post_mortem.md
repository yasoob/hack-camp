# Post-Mortem

9.4/10 average rating. Not bad.

Things we did well:

- Energizers
- "Freedom within structure"
  - Better in this cohort than the previous one.

Things we didn't do as well at:

- Wasn't always clear why we needed feedback when we asked for it
  - Perhaps do less feedback forms?
- Changing mindset
- Building community between participants
- One hacker was still on Scratch by the last day
- Personal notes
  - We can't review what we did and say what we did wrong with mindset
- Very strong separation between "coding time" and "other time"

To review our objective:

> The objective of the second cohort is to only do the first part of the Hack
> Camp objective: creating the experience. Our goal is to create an experience
> that brings people from no coding knowledge to having the ability, motivation,
> and confidence to create coding projects and continue learning new coding
> concepts with others, without the explicit urging or leading of a teacher.
>
> We should be taking personal notes on what we're doing and how we're doing it
> at this stage, but we shouldn't be creating documentation for others to
> reproduce our work yet.

We want every participant to leave _having the ability, motivation, and
confidence to create coding projects and continue learning new coding concepts
with others, without the explicit urging or leading of a teacher_.

Let's go student by student and see if we met this objective for each student.
